    I have several years experience as an enterprise UI/UX designer, working on complex native and web- based applications
    for financial institutions. During this time I followed the standard UX process for delivering high-quality designs on
    time—Discovery, Design, Validation, and Development. During Discovery, I researched user needs through site visits,
    interviews, contextual inquiries, and exploratory usability testing. I then synthesized the results into personas,
    customer journeys, and general customer knowledge which I used to make informed design decisions for new products and
    features.
</p>
<p>
    During Design, I worked with cross-functional teams, including Product Management, Architecture, and Engineering, and
    developed wireframes and mockups using tools like Sketch, Invision, Axure, Figma, and HTML/CSS/JavaScript. To create
    engaging and efficient designs, I drew inspiration from user research, prior work, competitor products, and standard and
    emerging design patterns.
</p>
<p>
    I have designed software for native desktops, desktop web, and mobile devices, and incorporated adaptive and responsive
    layouts to ensure web applications support a range of viewports. As part of my role, I have researched and conducted
    accessibility reviews to ensure that the designs follow WCAG 2.1 guidelines and meet ADA and Section 508 standards. I am
    quick to learn new tools and technologies and am always looking for ways to reduce design time while improving
    communication of the design with the team.
</p>
<p>
    As part of Validation, I facilitated design reviews with internal and external stakeholders and conducted both formal
    and informal testing with users. Using feedback from these sessions, I iterated through further design cycles to ensured
    that the designs met user needs, business goals and technical requirements.
</p>
<p>
    During Development, I worked closely with Engineering to ensure that the implementation closely followed the design. I
    contributed to and authored User Stories and Epics for Agile sprints, attended daily standups to address issues,
    participated in developer reviews, and generally made myself available for developer questions and feedback.
    Thank you for your time and consideration.
