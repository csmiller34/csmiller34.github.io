            <!--img class="avatar" src="/img/self.jpg" alt="Craig Miller photo"-->
   <p>I've been a full-time UX designer for over 15 years in the financial enteprise industry. Part of that time I've belonged to (small) UX teams and at other times I've been a team of one. My focus has been on three areas: user research, design and implementation, and validation. My particular strength is turning requirements into high fidelity prototypes which can be used to communicate the design to stakeholders.</p>
   <p>As I've worked closely with development, both organizationally and geographicaly, I am well versed in AGILE development practice and work alongside software developers in a consultory and often contributory role to drive the look &amp; feel and behaviour of our products to ensure that the final result exceeds the expectations of our consumers.</p>
