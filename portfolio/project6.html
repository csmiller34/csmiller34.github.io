   <h1>Summary</h1>
   <p>Branded two related projects: the first to create a white-label brand that could be customized for customers without code changes; the second to enable low-tech users to make common branding changes.</p>
   <h1>Roles</h1>
   <p>Designed and developed hi-fidelity mock-ups: one in Axure, the other in HTML+CSS+Javascript.</p>
</aside>

<p>The two branding projects in this section were enhancements to existing products.</p> 

<p>For the first project, we wanted to have a single white-label brand for two mobile plugin libraries. One plugin was ours, the other a third party's. The goal of the project was to have a common white label brand for both plugins (for both iOS and Android). Customer's could either use the white label brand as-is or customize it for their own brand.</p>

<p>The second project was to simplify application branding for a desktop web application. While larger customers had the resources to update CSS styles themselves, smaller customers and SaaS host administrators would not necessarily have the resources to make these changes. The goal of this project was to provide a simple, straightforward way to brand basic elements of the application.</p>

<h3>White Label Brand</h3>

<p>
   For this project, I used Axure to create a mockup of the white label branding changes we planned for a mobile plugin we developed. 
   The plug-in was designed to let users take a picture of a non-cheque document that would be included in a payment deposit.
   The intent of this project was to create a generic brand that could be re-skinned by individual customers to fit their own needs.
</p> 

<p>
   One of the limitations of this white label branding was to ensure that the plug-in looked and felt like another plug-in used by the application. 
   I tried to ensure that the plug-ins looked and felt consistent as users switched back and forth between them.

<p>
   This first mock-up went through a series of reviews by stakeholders and UX team members. One of the concerns was the visibility of the text when it was displayed overtop the document.
   In the next design round, I restyled the text so that it was more visible.
   In addition, much of the text on the help page was not helpful, so it was discarded for more pointed instructions on how to take clear pictures of cheques.
</p>

<p>
   The following screenshots show some of the improvements made to the mock-up following the iterative reviews.

<h3>Easy Branding</h3>

<p>For this project, I began by prioritizing which parts of the application are branded over other parts. I surveyed members of professional services and received a lot of useful feedback, which I turned into a list. I discussed this list with product management and go the go-ahead to begin design. The result was a mockup I created showing an addition to an administration page which would give users a sandbox within which to make style changes without impacting the application.</p>

<p>Here is a small <span class="strong">interactive</span> sample of that mock-up, which lets users try out stylings for application buttons.</p>
