         <h1 class="content">Developing Personas</h1>
         <p>After some staff turn-over, we decided to help newer team members better understand the audience they were developing and testing by assembling personas representing user archetypes of the different product lines. I worked with a member of the Information Products group to research and produce personas which we could use to communicate user characteristics to the team. Due to time and budget concerns we decided to go ahead with provisional personas, gathering information from customer-facing team members who could provide input. We also incorporated information from training videos from one of our major customers to supplement the other information we gathered.</p>

<p>To develop our personas, we proceeded as follows:</p>

<ol>
   <li>Prioritized the product lines which were most prominent and for which we could obtain the most information.</li>
   <li>Enumerated user types according to role (e.g., operators, supervisors, administrators) for the prioritized product lines.</li>
   <li>Developed a standardized list of questions to ask our participants.</li>
   <li>Developed template for persona assets.</li>
   <li>Researched and developed a behaviour/characteristics matrix for understanding the range of user attributes of a given user type.</li>
   <li>Recruited, scheduled, and interviewed customer-facing team members to interview.</li>
   <li>Reviewed and analyzed information chunks from recorded notes.</li>
   <li>Wrote up information sheets for each persona.</li>
</ol>

<p>After incorporating the information collected from research in the persona template, we produced several personas across three product lines. In addition to placing them in the team area, we discussed them with our team members and as a result were able to  transfer a lot of knowledge about users that would not otherwise be available to them.</p>
