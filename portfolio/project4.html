         <p>
   For this project, I used Axure to create a mockup of the white label branding changes we planned for a mobile plugin we developed. 
   The plug-in was designed to let users take a picture of a non-cheque document that would be included in a payment deposit.
   The intent of this project was to create a generic brand that could be re-skinned by individual customers to fit their own needs.
</p> 

<p>
   One of the limitations of this white label branding was to ensure that the plug-in looked and felt like another plug-in used by the application. 
   I tried to ensure that the plug-ins looked and felt consistent as users switched back and forth between them.

<p>
   This first mock-up went through a series of reviews by stakeholders and UX team members. One of the concerns was the visibility of the text when it was displayed overtop the document.
   In the next design round, I restyled the text so that it was more visible.
   In addition, much of the text on the help page was not helpful, so it was discarded for more pointed instructions on how to take clear pictures of cheques.
</p>

<p>
   The following screenshots show some of the improvements made to the mock-up following the iterative reviews.
