         <p>Unlike most of our other products which are enterprise level applications, Consumer Deposit was targeted at small business owners and home users. Since the user types of this application differed from our usual audience, we placed a greater emphasis into validating the design through summative usability testing.</p>

<p>To carry out usability test, we first developed a document defining our goals, time line, procedure, etc.</p>

</figure>

<p>Next, we developed the test materials needed to carry out the tests, namely, an orientation script, sample tasks and a checklist of activites that needed to be done before, during, and after each test.</p>

<p>At the same time we procured and configured out test environment. For this project, we used a laptop running the desktop web application connected with a flatbed scanner. On this laptop, we installed Morae Recorder and a version of the software running the new design.</p>

<p>Once completed, we recruited participants from other cross-functional teams in the office. Taking a lean approach, we conducted three tests of three participants each. We kept the number of participants low so that after each set of tests we could review the results, make updates to the application, and the re-test for each set of tests.</p>

<p>This approach proved invaluable as we were able to identify problems quickly and because we had access to and understanding of HTML and CSS, we could make rapid changes to the application. For example, one issue that came up during the first round of testing was confusion over the "scan" task. Due to ambiguious labeling on the page, users were unsure if they were supposed to click the <span class="strong">Scan</span> button on the page or press the Scan button on the physical scanner. By experimenting with a few variations, we were able to change the label to differentiate between what was displayed on the page and the physcial scanner.</p>

<p>Following the usability tests, we wrote up a report and presented the findings, along with recorded video snippets, to the development team. As a result of this testing, we identified problems both at the presentation level and at the actual programming flow. The problems were prioritized and updates were made to the software in subsequent releases.</p>
