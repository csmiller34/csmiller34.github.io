         <p class="portfolio-p">Although not tied to a specific deliverable we had the opportunity to visit a bank branch for one of our customers. This site was one of the pilot bank branches running the bank version of our software/hardware solutions. The goal of the visit was to see first-hand how the branch tellers were interacting with our solution during a typical business day.</p>

<p>For this activity, I traveled solo to Raleigh, N.C. to meet with two of the bank's Operation staff. I received some background on the branch and a short history of the pilot program. Due to security concerns, I was to focus on back-office operations rather than front-desk, and limit interruptions to the tellers as they were focused on customer care. Also, since the visit was scheduled for a single afternoon I limited the scope to include:</p>

<ul>
   <li>observe branch tellers interacting with our application</li>
   <li>ask tellers questions while they are using the application</li>
   <li>hold a debriefing conversation with the bank Operations staff</li>
</ul>

<p>Over the course of the afternoon, I waited in the back-room where our software/hardware was location. At various points over a couple of hours the head teller left his station at the wicket and brought documents needing to be scanned into our system. I watched as he interacted with the system, noting the tasks he performed and any problems he had while performing them.</p>

<p>Highlights from the session included:</p>
<ul>
   <li>the customer was pleased with the recent hardware update over the old equipment</li>
   <li>an observation for an area of improvement on the scanning failure and recovery process</li>
   <li>insight on an opportunity for a new product</li>
   <li>a better understanding on how tellers use this specific product to inform design on upcoming projects</li>
</ul>

<p>At the conclusion of the visit I took my notes along with copies of some documents used by branch tellers to use the system, including instructional material and a troubleshooting guide.</p>

<p>After returning from the customer visit, I shared the information I gathered on our CMS and wrote up a report detailing the environment, process, and issues which went to the customer.</p>
