<h5>Work Experience</h5>
<h6 class="h6-under-heading">User Interface and User Experience Design</h6>
<ul>
    <li>Researched user behaviour, needs, and goals through surveys, interviews, contextual inquiry and usability testing. The results of research were analyzed and written up as reports and presented to the team. Gathered information also led to other artifacts such as personas and customer journeys, and informed future design.</li>
    <li>Designed user interfaces using whiteboard sketches, paper mock-ups, wireframes, and interactive browser-based prototypes. These were documented within screen flow diagrams, UI walkthroughs, and UI specifications.</li>
    <li>Contributed to and wrote JIRA stories and epics to define requirements around user interaction. Stories included links to mockups and other design artifacts to assist developers with implementation.</li>
    <li>Conducted usability inspections and tests on prototype designs to ensure they met user needs. Feedback from these sessions was incorporated into the design for subsequent testing.</li>
    <li>Facilitated design reviews and led walkthroughs of prototypes for internal and external stakeholders and customers. These sessions included team members, customers, and management.</li>
    <li>Worked closely with developers during implementation to resolve technical and design issues. I attended daily standups and participated in developer demos to identify and resolve issues as quickly as possible.</li>
    <li>Provided field engineers with CSS changes to address customer requests.</li>
    <li>Updated the CSS for a legacy suite of application as a cost-savings alternative to re-development.</li>
    <li>Led and conducted accessibility reviews of a web application to ensure that it followed WCAG 2.1 guidelines and complied with ADA and Section 508 standards.</li>
