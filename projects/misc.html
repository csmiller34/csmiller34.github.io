<h6>Customer Visit</h6>

<p class="portfolio-p">Although not tied to a specific deliverable we had the opportunity to visit a bank branch for one of our customers. This site was one of the pilot bank branches running the bank version of our software/hardware solutions. The goal of the visit was to see first-hand how the branch tellers were interacting with our solution during a typical business day.</p>

 </section>
  
<p>For this activity, I traveled solo to Raleigh, N.C. to meet with two of the bank's Operation staff. I received some background on the branch and a short history of the pilot program. Due to security concerns, I was to focus on back-office operations rather than front-desk, and limit interruptions to the tellers as they were focused on customer care. Also, since the visit was scheduled for a single afternoon I limited the scope to include:</p>

<ul>
   <li>observe branch tellers interacting with our application</li>
   <li>ask tellers questions while they are using the application</li>
   <li>hold a debriefing conversation with the bank Operations staff</li>
</ul>

<p>Over the course of the afternoon, I waited in the back-room where our software/hardware was location. At various points over a couple of hours the head teller left his station at the wicket and brought documents needing to be scanned into our system. I watched as he interacted with the system, noting the tasks he performed and any problems he had while performing them.</p>

<p>Highlights from the session included:</p>
<ul>
   <li>the customer was pleased with the recent hardware update over the old equipment</li>
   <li>an observation for an area of improvement on the scanning failure and recovery process</li>
   <li>insight on an opportunity for a new product</li>
   <li>a better understanding on how tellers use this specific product to inform design on upcoming projects</li>
</ul>

<p>At the conclusion of the visit I took my notes along with copies of some documents used by branch tellers to use the system, including instructional material and a troubleshooting guide.</p>

<p>After returning from the customer visit, I shared the information I gathered on our CMS and wrote up a report detailing the environment, process, and issues which went to the customer.</p>

<h6>Confluence Assessment</h6>

<p class="portfolio-p">Following the deployment of a content management system within the local site, the site management team was looking for ways to increase adoption across the various teams in the organization.</p>

<p>Our UX team undertook a user research approach to better understanding how the CMS was being perceived and used as well as identifying the pain points preventing the various end users from engaging in the system</p>

<p>To complete the Confluence assessment, we completed the following steps:
<ol>
   <li>Identify goals of assessement.</li>
   <li>Identify scope of assessment.</li>
   <li>Identify test subjects across funtional areas.</li>
   <li>Determine technology to record each test.</li>
   <li>Identify tasks to be completed by each test subject.</li>
   <li>Write, review, and revise introduction and tasks.</li>
   <li>Carry out assessments with test subjects.</li>
   <li>Capture problems, comments, suggestions, and observations from sessions.</li>
   <li>Affinitize problems, comments, suggestoins, and observations.</li>
   <li>Create a report based on research.</li>
   <li>Present findings to site mangagement.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p class="portfolio-p">Following the research activities, we summarized our findings and created a report detailing these findings. We also scheduled a powerpoint presentation to the site management team to communicate the findings.</p>

<h5 id="personas">Persona Development<a href="#top-of-page" class="return-to-top" title="Return to top"></a></h5>

<p>After some staff turn-over, we decided to help newer team members better understand the audience they were developing and testing by assembling personas representing user archetypes of the different product lines. I worked with a member of the Information Products group to research and produce personas which we could use to communicate user characteristics to the team. Due to time and budget concerns we decided to go ahead with provisional personas, gathering information from customer-facing team members who could provide input. We also incorporated information from training videos from one of our major customers to supplement the other information we gathered.</p>

<p>To develop our personas, we proceeded as follows:</p>

<ol>
   <li>Prioritized the product lines which were most prominent and for which we could obtain the most information.</li>
   <li>Enumerated user types according to role (e.g., operators, supervisors, administrators) for the prioritized product lines.</li>
   <li>Developed a standardized list of questions to ask our participants.</li>
   <li>Developed template for persona assets.</li>
   <li>Researched and developed a behaviour/characteristics matrix for understanding the range of user attributes of a given user type.</li>
   <li>Recruited, scheduled, and interviewed customer-facing team members to interview.</li>
   <li>Reviewed and analyzed information chunks from recorded notes.</li>
   <li>Wrote up information sheets for each persona.</li>
</ol>

    <label for="perosona-notes" class="caption-image">Messy notes collected from participant interviews</label>
 </section>

<p>After incorporating the information collected from research in the persona template, we produced several personas across three product lines. In addition to placing them in the team area, we discussed them with our team members and as a result were able to  transfer a lot of knowledge about users that would not otherwise be available to them.</p>

<h5 id="usability">Usability Testing<a href="#top-of-page" class="return-to-top" title="Return to top"></a></h5>

<p>Unlike most of our other products which are enterprise level applications, Consumer Deposit was targeted at small business owners and home users. Since the user types of this application differed from our usual audience, we placed a greater emphasis into validating the design through summative usability testing.</p>

<p>To carry out usability test, we first developed a document defining our goals, time line, procedure, etc.</p>

<section class="portfolio-image">
  <img id="consumer-plan" src="/img/misc1a/consumer-plan.png" alt="Plan validating Consumer Deposit">
  <label for="consumer-plan" class="caption-image">Plan validating Consumer Deposit</label>
</section>

<p>Next, we developed the test materials needed to carry out the tests, namely, an orientation script, sample tasks and a checklist of activites that needed to be done before, during, and after each test.</p>

<p>At the same time we procured and configured out test environment. For this project, we used a laptop running the desktop web application connected with a flatbed scanner. On this laptop, we installed Morae Recorder and a version of the software running the new design.</p>

<p>Once completed, we recruited participants from other cross-functional teams in the office. Taking a lean approach, we conducted three tests of three participants each. We kept the number of participants low so that after each set of tests we could review the results, make updates to the application, and the re-test for each set of tests.</p>

<p>This approach proved invaluable as we were able to identify problems quickly and because we had access to and understanding of HTML and CSS, we could make rapid changes to the application. For example, one issue that came up during the first round of testing was confusion over the "scan" task. Due to ambiguious labeling on the page, users were unsure if they were supposed to click the <span class="strong">Scan</span> button on the page or press the Scan button on the physical scanner. By experimenting with a few variations, we were able to change the label to differentiate between what was displayed on the page and the physcial scanner.</p>

<p>Following the usability tests, we wrote up a report and presented the findings, along with recorded video snippets, to the development team. As a result of this testing, we identified problems both at the presentation level and at the actual programming flow. The problems were prioritized and updates were made to the software in subsequent releases.</p>
