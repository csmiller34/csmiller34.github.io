      <h1>Summary</h1>
      <p>Refactored an existing phone application's layout for tablet. Needed to be completed quickly with minimal development time.</p>
      <h1>Roles</h1>
      <p>design, mock-up, css development, javascript tweaking</p>
   </aside>

   <p>The goal of the project was to enhance an existing mobile application designed specifically for phone-sized form factor to also run in a tablet-sized form factor. As part of this project, we also wanted to improve user efficiently using the application so that fewer steps were needed to complete tasks and to reuse as many pages as possible to reduce development time. To achieve this goal, we combined two design approaches: adaptive and responsive. For the parts of the application we wanted to redesign, we reviewed the application flow and identified the pages we could combine or remove. For the parts of the application we wanted to make responsive, we redesigned pages to improve user interaction and aesthetics.</p> 

   <p>This project had the following design deliverables:</p>

   <ul>
      <li>application flow diagram</li>
      <li>application UI design</li>
      <li>responsive CSS</li>
   </ul>

   <h2>Application Flow Diagram</h2>

   <p>To determine the new workflow, I used a white board to first draw out the existing application flow and then, below it, sketch out alternatives that would both improve user efficiency by reducing unnecessary steps and meet the development time-line.</p>

   <p>As a team, we discussed  discussing the advantages and disadvantages of each design and then settled on the most effective design.</p>

   <p>Once we established which screens, I mapped out all the pages to determine which ones were being replaced and which ones needed to incorporate responsive design:</p>

   <p>As a result of this activity, I determined about 1/3 of the application pages were new and the remaining 2/3 needed to incorporate responsive design.</p>

   <h2>Application UI Design</h2>

   <p>To design the new pages that would replace one or more existing ones, I reviewed the functionality of each screen and sketched out three different designs that incorporated each function. After some review with the development team, we settled on a single designs for Deposit View and Item View pages.</p>

   <p>From the white-board designs, I went ahead and created HTML and CSS prototypes to show the page transition from and to these new pages. After presenting these new pages/flows with the various stakeholders, I made design updates to improve consistency across the pages.</p>

   <h2>Responsive CSS</h2>

   <p>Once the new pages were designed and incorporated into JIRA stories for development to begin, I moved on the pages needing to incorporate responsive design. As part of the business requirements, we needed to ensure that existing customer deployments would not be affected by the retro-fitted adaptive/responsive pages. To meet this, I organized all the responsive changes into a new SCSS file (_responsive.scss) that left existing pages with their current HTML, class names, and styles. This new responsive flie contained the new media queries so that our application responded correctly to tablets of varying size in landscape and portrait orientations.</p>

   <p>One potential issue with this strategy was the added complexity of the customization process. With our help, customers brand the application to meet their organization's guidelines. Retro-fitting responsive CSS media queries without an overhaul of existing class names meant some loss of semantic meaning of the existing tags. After some discussion with Product Management, we decided that this trade-off was acceptable if we could meet the aggressive deadline to get this product to market.</p>

   <p>Once the responsive CSS changes were completed, we reviewed the new layouts with stakeholders and incorporated their feedback into a quick, second iteration. These changes were signed off and the pages were handed off for testing.</p>

   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   
   <p>Both the newly designed pages (i.e., the adaptive part of the project) and the pages designed to be responsive were completed and the project was released on time. Our team was new with mobile development and we encountered several issues along the way, particularly around pop-overs and scrolling. However, the design proved solid and the new tablet pages were received well both internally by the support organization as well as the external audience.</p>
